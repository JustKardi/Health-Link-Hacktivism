        This HTML code enables users to access detailed disease information based on their selected city.

This engaging approach not only enhances health literacy but also empowers users to make informed decisions about their health.

    AI VIRUS DIAGNOSTIC ASSISTANT:

Based on this information, the app provides insights into potential viruses, recommends over-the-counter medications, and suggests nearby doctors for further consultation.

    HOSPITAL LOCATIONS:
        The HTML code creates a web page that displays a hospital map, allowing users to find hospitals based on their current location. It uses JavaScript to retrieve the user's geolocation, places markers for both the user and the selected hospital, and offers driving directions via the Google Maps API, enhancing navigation to healthcare facilities.
